# honeypots deployed

Only the dionaea honeypot was deployed.

# issues

Some very minor setup issues, but mostly resulted in trying to run a command in the wrong terminal and then also not have enabled the API for billing properly.

I also accidentally attacked the admin server.

# unresolved questions

None.
